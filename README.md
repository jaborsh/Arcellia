## Lore

In the heart of Valaria, Empress Eveline, a paragon of beauty and wisdom, sat on the throne. Her reign was a delicate dance of justice and empathy, her commands woven with the elegance of a seasoned silvertongue. The Empress, despite her aristocratic roots, bore a heart that beat for every citizen, infusing her empire with a rare blend of prosperity and peace.

Yet beneath Eveline's bleeding heart, Valaria's political landscape was threaded with more than just a single weave. The aristocracy, where Eveline hailed from, formed one strand, their influence running deep in the city's veins. They were custodians of wealth and tradition, their lineage as old as the city itself. 

Another crucial thread was the theocrats. This devout collective of priests and priestesses governed the spiritual life of Valaria, their influence swaying from the most impoverished commoner to the highest-ranking politician. Their authority was a divine mandate, their words received as direct decrees from the heavens.

Empress Eveline, in her wisdom, managed to strike a harmonious balance between these two powerful factions, and thus received the endorsement of the pious, their divine blessing acting as a heavenly seal upon her reign. In return, she allowed their doctrines.

Beneath the veneer of harmony, a discordant note began to emerge. A third faction rose, composed of intellectuals, philosophers, and freethinkers. They advocated reason over tradition, innovation over blind faith. They saw the theocratic influence as a gilded cage and the aristocratic control as a velvet noose, restricting the city and its denizens.

This tripartite tension remained an undercurrent, held at bay by the public enamor for their Empress, until one fateful evening where she was found stabbed, bloodied, and lifeless. Without its monarch, Arcellia plunged into despair, their guiding light vanquished. Eveline's light was more than a personal loss; it was the collapse of a delicate equilibrium. The theocrats declared this as divine will, urging for a ruler with even deeper devotion to the gods. The aristocrats feared losing their hold on power and pushed for one of their own to ascend. For others, this was a chance, a beacon in the dark, to steer Valaria elsewhere.

While the streets echo with cries of anguish for their late Empress, in the grand palaces of the nobility, another game is afoot. The nobles, once content in their roles as spectators, now realize the throne is empty, and one must rise to fill it.
