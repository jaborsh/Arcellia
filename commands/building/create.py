    Syntax: create[/drop] <objname>[;alias;alias...][:typeclass], <objname>...

    switch:
       drop - automatically drop the new object into your current
              location (this is not echoed). This also sets the new
              object's home to the current location rather than to you.

    Creates one or more new objects. If typeclass is given, the object
    is created as a child of this typeclass. The typeclass script is
    assumed to be located under types/ and any further
    directory structure is given in Python notation. So if you have a
    correct typeclass 'RedButton' defined in
    types/examples/red_button.py, you could create a new
    object of this type like this:

       create/drop button;red : examples.red_button.RedButton
