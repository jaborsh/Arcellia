    "desc": "The robe swathes its wearer in the comfort of carefully woven fabric, a modest guardian against the caress of wind and the kiss of rain. Its color, a muted hue akin to the rich brown of tilled earth, blends with the pallet of the natural world, shifting from village path to forest glen. A deep and encompassing hood lies in repose along the garment's back, ready to be drawn forth and over one's crowning glory. Sleeves billow gently, granting freedom to arms that might gesture in incantation or embrace the elements with outstretched fingertips. A simple cord of braided fiber encircles the waist, gathering the garment close and warding the body from the chills of night. Alas, for all its earnest weaving, the robe offers naught but the thinnest barrier to more corporeal threats, yielding with quiet resignation to steel that might seek to breach its folds.",
    "senses": {
        "feel": "Against the skin, the robe feels like a comforting embrace, a whisper of safety amidst the embrace of the open sky.",
        "smell": "The scent of loom-spun cloth, fresh and homely, pervades the robe, evoking the diligent hands that crafted each thread into shelter.",
        "sound": "The fabric flutters with a gentle hush, harmonious with the sighs and songs of nature's enfolding arms.",
        "taste": "Near this garment, the taste of a home hearth's warmth seems to linger, a silent promise that, though simple, the robe serves as a steadfast companion.",
