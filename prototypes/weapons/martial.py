    "desc": "A curved sword reminiscient of the crescent moon. Forged of gleaming steel, the weapon possesses a lustrous sheen, its edge honed to a keen sharpness. The furface of the blade reflects ambient light and casts a dance of silvery patterns on its surroundings. Its spine robust yet elegant, arcs in harmony with the cutting edge. The hilt is fashioned with modesty, a functional coupling of unadorned wood and a simple crossguard, which flares subtly to protect deft fingers. Wrapped tightly in worn leather, the grip provides a secure hold, the scimitar becoming an extension of the wielder's arm. A rounded pommel completes the weapon, counterbalancing the blade's weight.",

    "desc": "A prime example of a weapon that has found its place at the sides of many, its length and balance ideal for those who traverse the unpredictable. The blade, straight and forged of sturdy steel, extends with purpose from its unadorned crossguard, the surface gleaming with the polish of a well-maintained armament. Its double edges are honed sufficiently to bite into the clamor of combat or glide silently from a scabbard in a moonlit alleyway. The hilt is pragmatic, wrapped in a coarse, dark cloth that ensures a steadfast grip whether in the gauntleted hand of a watchman or the bare fingers of a rogue. The pommel, a simple globe of steel, serves to counterweight the blade.",
