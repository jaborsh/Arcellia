    "desc": "This hand-axe, unassuming in its construct, bears the honest wear of a tool often summoned to cleave wood, or, in darker times, to silence the whispers of adversaries with its bite of steel. The blade, broad and once sharp, now bears the subtle inscriptions of use, its edge nicked from encounters with tough fibres and perhaps the grim resistance of bone. A certain simplicity defines its form, the metal head faithful to function, its surface marred by flecks of rust and dark stains that speak to its labor and the secrets it keeps. The axe's haft is crafted of sturdy wood that has darkened over time, the patina deepening in the grooves where hands have gripped, swung, and struck with the weight of necessity. A leathery thong is bound at its base, frayed from the toil of many grasps, allowing for a surer hold or to hang from a sturdy peg after the day's exertions.",
    "senses": {
        "feel": "The hand-axe conveys a utilitarian firmness to the touch, its haft echoing stories of survival and resolve.",
        "smell": "Notes of ancient wood, tinged with the iron-clad scent of its head, linger about this unadorned hatchet.",
        "sound": "In its use, the hand-axe provides a satisfying thunk, the auditory hallmark of tasks completed, be they mundane or morbid.",
        "taste": "In the air around the axe, there rests a faint metallic sharpness, a reminder of the blade's history etched in steel and sap-or something more visceral.",
