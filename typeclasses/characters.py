Characters

Characters are (by default) Objects setup to be puppeted by Accounts.
They are what you "see" in game. The Character class in this module
is setup to be the "default" character type created by the default
creation commands.

class Character(ObjectParent, DefaultCharacter):
    """
    The Character defaults to reimplementing some of base Object's hook methods with the
    following functionality:

    at_basetype_setup - always assigns the DefaultCmdSet to this object type
                    (important!)sets locks so character cannot be picked up
                    and its commands only be called by itself, not anyone else.
                    (to change things, use at_object_creation() instead).
    at_post_move(source_location) - Launches the "look" command after every move.
    at_post_unpuppet(account) -  when Account disconnects from the Character, we
                    store the current location in the pre_logout_location Attribute and
                    move it to a None-location so the "unpuppeted" character
                    object does not need to stay on grid. Echoes "Account has disconnected"
                    to the room.
    at_pre_puppet - Just before Account re-connects, retrieves the character's
                    pre_logout_location Attribute and move it back on the grid.
    at_post_puppet - Echoes "AccountName has entered the game" to the room.

        Args:
            text (str or tuple, optional): The message to send. This
                is treated internally like any send-command, so its
                value can be a tuple if sending multiple arguments to
                the `text` oob command.
            from_obj (obj or list, optional): object that is sending. If
                given, at_msg_send will be called. This value will be
                passed on to the protocol. If iterable, will execute hook
                on all entities in it.
            session (Session or list, optional): Session or list of
                Sessions to relay data to, if any. If set, will force send
                to these sessions. If unset, who receives the message
                depends on the MULTISESSION_MODE.
            options (dict, optional): Message-specific option-value
                pairs. These will be applied at the protocol level.
        Keyword Args:
            any (string or tuples): All kwarg keys not listed above
                will be treated as send-command names and their arguments
                (which can be a string or a tuple).

        Notes:
            `at_msg_receive` will be called on this Object.
