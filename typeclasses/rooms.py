    Room states:
      A room state is set as a Tag with category "roomstate" and tagkey "on_fire" or "flooded"
      etc).

    Alternative descriptions:
    - Add an Attribute `desc_<roomstate>` to the room, where <roomstate> is the name of the
      roomstate to use this for, like `desc_on_fire` or `desc_flooded`. If not given, seasonal
      descriptions given in desc_spring/summer/autumn/winter will be used, and last the
      regular `desc` Attribute.

    Alternative text sections
    - Used to add alternative text sections to the room description. These are embedded in the
      description by adding `$state(roomstate, txt)`. They will show only if the room is in the
      given roomstate. These are managed via the add/remove/get_alt_text methods.

    Details:
    - This is set as an Attribute `details` (a dict) on the room, with the detail name as key.
      When looking at this room, the detail name can be used as a target to look at without having
      to add an actual database object for it. The `detail` command is used to add/remove details.

    Room messages
    - Set `room_message_rate > 0` and add a list of `room_messages`. These will be randomly
      echoed to the room at the given rate.
