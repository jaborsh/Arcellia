    "desc": "A long, flowing robe of deep teal, its fabric shimmering faintly in the light, as though woven with threads of shadow and sea. The robe's hood is spacious, easily able to obscure the wearer's features entirely, leaving nothing but the glint of their eyes visible from beneath. Intricate patterns, resembling the twisting currents of a stormy ocean, trace the edges of the hem and cuffs, hinting at ancient arcane origins.",
    "senses": {
        "feel": "The fabric is cool and slick, like water slipping through one's fingers.",
        "smell": "A faint scent of salt and brine clings to the cloth, as though it once traveled far across unknown seas.",
        "sound": "The robe makes no sound as it moves, gliding with the silence of a shadow in moonlight.",
        "taste": "A subtle, almost imperceptible taste of saltwater lingers in the air near its fabric.",
    },
