    "desc": "A threadbare garment, once grand in some forgotten age, now reduced to mere scraps of moth-eaten fabric hanging in tatters. Its once-rich hues have faded to a dull, sickly brown, worn thin at the edges and frayed beyond repair.",
    "senses": {
        "feel": "Rough and brittle, the fabric feels as if it would crumble at the lightest touch.",
        "smell": "A faint odor of mildew and dust clings to it, as though it has not been touched by fresh air in centuries.",

    "senses": {
        "feel": "The leather is stiff, yielding as much as a dry stick and rough to the touch.",
        "smell": "A sharp, acrid scent of rotting leather fills the air, mixing unpleasantly with the odor of damp soil.",
        "sound": "The boots make a soft creak, like the faint protest of a brittle branch, with each step.",

    "desc": "A cloak of faded green that drapes heavily from the shoulders, its edges tattered and worn as if chewed by the teeth of time and neglect. Faint traces of embroidery hint at a forgotten insignia, though now only the shadow of its glory remains.",
    "senses": {
        "feel": "Its fabric is coarse and frayed, rough to the touch, and prone to catching on the slightest protrusion.",
        "smell": "A faint, earthy musk clings to it, reminiscent of damp caverns and long journeys.",
        "sound": "It rustles softly when moved, a whispery shuffling that seems to merge with the shadows.",
        "taste": "The taste of ancient dust and stale air permeates the fabric, as though it has absorbed the essence of countless roads.",
