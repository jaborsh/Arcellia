        "typeclass": "world.xyzgrid.xyzroom.XYZRoom",
        "desc": "Standing tall and imposing, the ancient gate of Emberlyn is a weathered relic of a forgotten era. Hewn from dark stone and worn smooth by centuries of wind and rain, the gate remains open, its massive iron doors now resting on either side like weary guardians. Vines creep up along the stone walls, their tendrils twisting through the cracks, a sign that nature is slowly reclaiming this once proud structure. The path leading through the gate is paved with cracked cobblestones, their surface uneven and faded.",
        "senses": {
            "feel": "The stone beneath your feet is cool and rough, worn by the passage of time and countless travelers.",
            "smell": "A faint hint of moss and damp stone fills the air, mixed with the earthy scent of the vines creeping along the walls.",
            "sound": "The wind whistles softly through the open gate, carrying distant sounds of life from within the town of Emberlyn.",
            "taste": "The air is tinged with the taste of old stone and iron, faint but lingering on your tongue.",
        },
        "details": {
            "iron doors": "The massive iron doors are rusted and worn, their once polished surfaces now pitted and dull, hanging open as if frozen in time.",
            "vines": "The vines that wind their way up the stone are thick and dark green, their leaves glossy, with small flowers budding in the crevices of the wall.",
            "cobblestones": "The cobblestones that pave the ground are cracked and uneven, some missing entirely, while others are deeply grooved, bearing witness to the countless feet that have passed through this gate.",
